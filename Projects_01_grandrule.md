P1 Grand Rule Challenge
=======================

This challenge was considered too difficult for 2 hours. But it should be enough for your project.

You can read the assignment on the attached pdf and you should ask the instructor for datasets to test.

The goal is to achieve the best performance possible. You can use multithreaded or GPU parallelization. 

The paper should focus on explaining your strategy, including how you evaluate your performance.

Tips: 

- using the right data structure may help more than the parallelization strategy.
- start by writing a sequential version of the solution.
